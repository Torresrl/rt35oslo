          <h2 class="faq-question">What are the alcohol laws in Norway?</h2>
          <p class="faq-answer">The alcohol laws in Norway are quite strict. Beer and beverages with up to 4.7% can be bought in most supermarkets until 20:00 
            on weekdays and 18:00 on Saturdays. Wine, spirits or other beverages with more than 4.7% can only be bought in shops called “Vinmonopolet” until 18:00 on weekdays and 15:00 on Saturdays. 
            It’s not allowed to drink in public outside of a serving area for a bar or restaurant. You can be fined by the police if they see it. It’s not allowed to 
            bring along or enjoy alcohol (or any other beverages for that matter) in bars or restaurants. Bars and nightclubs can’t serve alcohol before 10:00 and have to close 03:00 the latest. 
            
            The legal drinking age for beer, wine and cider is 18. 20 for spirits such as vodka, gin and rum.
