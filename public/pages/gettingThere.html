        <h1>Traveling to Oslo</h1>
        <p>Oslo is in the Southern part of Norway, well connected by all means of transportation.</p>
    
        <p>International flights are to Oslo Airport Gardermoen which is only 20min away from the city center via
            airport
            express train. All major airlines, as well as several lowcost, fly to Oslo.</p>
    
        <h2>Transportation in Oslo</h2>
    
        <p>Nice apps to have:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Flytoget (Airport Express train)</li>
            <li>Ruter (All public transport in Oslo, busses, subway and tram).</li>
            <li>VY (Train)</li>
            <li>Bolt (taxi)</li>
            <li>Uber (Taxi)</li>
        </ul>
    
        <p>From Oslo Airport it’s suggested to take the train. You can either take the AirPort Express (20€) or the
            regional train (10€). AirPort Express is slightly faster and a bit more comfortable. Tickets can be bought
            on sight on Ticket Terminals, or through the apps.</p>
    
        <p>Take the train to Oslo Central Station (Oslo S).</p>
    
        <p>It’s highly recommended to only use taxi through the apps mentioned, as the price and route is set and
            reasonable. It can get quite expensive if you just get one from the street.</p>
